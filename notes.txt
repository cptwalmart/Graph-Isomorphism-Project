Graph Isomorphism
* If two graphs are look the same, but the number of verticies and edges are not the same, then it is not isomorphic.
* If there is one to one maping function between the verticies then it called isomorphic.
* If all properties of graph isomorphism are satisfied then two graphs are said to be isomorphic, else they are not.

Properties of Graph Isormorphism:
1) Number of verticies should be equal for each graph
2) Number of edges should be equal for each graph
3) In Degree and Out Degree should be equal
4) Numbe of connected components should be the same
5) Number of loops should be the same
6) Number of parallel edges should be the same

Examples of practical applications of graph isomorphism
chemical structures
social networks
CAD
Image Processing
Protein structures
Biometrics

Real world applications of Isomorphic algorithms are actually quite fast and specialized

Subgraph isomorphism is known to be NP-Complete
(Will probably add as another algorithm)
