abstract = "An open question is the computational complexity of recognizing when two graphs are isomorphic. In an attempt to answer this question we shall analyze the relative computational complexity of generalizations and restrictions of the graph isomorphism problem. We show graph isomorphism of regular undirected graphs is complete over isomorphism of explicitly given structures (say Tarski models from logic). We also show a fundamental difference between how automorphism groups can act on a graph of valence n and how they can act on graphs of valence n + 1 (with one exception). This group theoretic result seems to have implications on the role of valence for graph isomorphism algorithms. Finally, we introduce “certificates” for symmetric cubic graphs."

abstract = "We report the current state of the graph isomorphism problem from the practical point of view. After describing the general principles of the refinement-individualization paradigm and pro ving its validity, we explain how it is implemented in several of the key implementations. In particular, we bring the description of the best known program nauty up to date and describe an innovative approach called Traces that outperforms the competitors for many difficult graph classes. Detailed comparisons against saucy, Bliss and conauto are presented."

abstract = "It is unknown whether two graphs can be tested for isomorphism in polynomial time. A classical approach to the Graph Isomorphism Problem is the d-dimensional Weisfeiler–Lehman algorithm. The d-dimensional WL-algorithm can distinguish many pairs of graphs, but the pairs of non-isomorphic graphs constructed by Cai, Fürer and Immerman it cannot distinguish. If d is fixed, then the WL-algorithm runs in polynomial time. We will formulate the Graph Isomorphism Problem as an Orbit Problem: Given a representation V of an algebraic group G and two elements v1,v2∈V, decide whether v1 and v2 lie in the same G-orbit. Then we attack the Orbit Problem by constructing certain approximate categories Cd, d∈N={1,2,3,…} whose objects include the elements of V. We show that v1 and v2 are not in the same orbit by showing that they are not isomorphic in the category Cd for some d∈N. For every d this gives us an algorithm for isomorphism testing. We will show that the WL-algorithms reduce to our algorithms, but that our algorithms cannot be reduced to the WL-algorithms. Unlike the Weisfeiler–Lehman algorithm, our algorithm can distinguish the Cai–Fürer–Immerman graphs in polynomial time."
