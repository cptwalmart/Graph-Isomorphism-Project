COSC 320 Final Project Outline

1) Introduction to Graph Isomorphism
    • Definition of the term
    • Properties there of
    • Uses in the real world
    • What is P, NP, NP-Complete, NP-Hard
    • Terminology and mathematics that will be used

2) History of the Algorithm
    • Some of the previous algorithms
    • Their run times
    • Sub-problems of the algorithm
    • The 2015 algorithm and its quasi-polynomial run time

3)Significance of the problem and real world applications
    • If possible some of the specific algorithms used in real life applications
    • The different problems that use isomorphic graph mapping

4) My algorithm and current research and the future of graph isomorphism.
    • Talk about detail of my algorithm and why I chose to approach things the way I did
    • Talk about other algorithms that exist for the problems
    • General run time of the programs
    • Any future ideas that I find relating to it
5) Conclusions
