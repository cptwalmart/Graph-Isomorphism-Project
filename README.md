### General Notes

Graph Isomorphism turned into a very interesting topic for myself. While at first I was overwhelmed by the abundance of potential papers I could resource as well as potential algorithms and specific sub fields of the topic, however I enjoyed my time of coming to understand better one of the classic computer science problems. Trying to parse some of the fields paper's proved to be a challenge for me, but eventually I was able to use notes to put together a brute force algorithm to test graph isomorphism. It should run in O(N^2-N!), however it seemed to run much faster over my test runs. I can only imagine I put in poor testing data for the problem. As far as improving the code, I know putting in a file read system so I could populate graphs using text files would of been more efficent for testing, and would of also allowed me to test a wider variety of patterns. I wish I had given myself enough time to implement more algorithms than the one, but as it was trying to parse this one together was quite the task.

#### Adendum

I would also like to thank my friend Blake Thomas for proofreading everything and helping me to improve in computer science, and my friend "Scudzy" for his advice on how to clean up my code. You guys are awesome.
